Research on Power Grid Material Demand Forecasting
1️⃣ Introduction

Accurate forecasting of grid materials (steel, conductors, insulators, transformers) is critical for planning, procurement, and cost optimization. Rising energy demand, electrification, and renewable integration increase the need for precise predictions.

Scope: Time series forecasting, ML, DL, and hybrid models focused on transmission line components.

2️⃣ General Demand Forecasting in Power Systems

Purpose: Grid stability via short-term (hours–days), medium-term (weeks–months), long-term (years) forecasts.

Traditional Methods:

ARIMA / Variants: Good for stationary series; struggles with seasonality & renewables volatility.

Exponential Smoothing: Captures trends/seasonality; often used in hybrids.

Econometric Models: Use GDP, prices for long-term planning.

Applications: Congestion management, redispatch, renewable integration. Short-term forecasts help real-time scheduling; long-term guides infrastructure upgrades.
