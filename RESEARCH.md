## 2️⃣ General Demand Forecasting in Power Systems

**Purpose:** Grid stability via short-term (hours–days), medium-term (weeks–months), long-term (years) forecasts.

### Traditional Methods:
- **ARIMA / Variants:** Good for stationary series; struggles with seasonality & renewables volatility.
- **Exponential Smoothing:** Captures trends/seasonality; often used in hybrids.
- **Econometric Models:** Use GDP, prices for long-term planning.

### Applications:
- Congestion management, redispatch, renewable integration.
- Short-term forecasts help real-time scheduling; long-term guides infrastructure upgrades.
