## 🌟 Overview

**Predicto** is an intelligent demand forecasting system designed specifically for POWERGRID infrastructure projects. Built as a **Smart India Hackathon 2025 prototype**, it revolutionizes supply chain management by predicting material requirements with exceptional accuracy.

### The Challenge

Power grid construction projects face critical challenges:
- ⚠️ Unpredictable material demand leading to procurement delays
- 📦 Excess inventory costs and storage inefficiencies
- 🔴 Stockouts causing project timeline disruptions
- 📉 Inefficient supply chain planning

### Our Solution

Predicto leverages advanced machine learning and time-series forecasting to predict quarterly demand for critical materials including steel, conductors, insulators, and transformers. The system analyzes historical trends, project parameters, and seasonal variations to deliver actionable insights.

**🎯 Result:** Optimize procurement, reduce inventory costs by up to 40%, and eliminate costly stockouts.
