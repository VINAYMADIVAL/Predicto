1️⃣ Project Status Overview
The repository contains a working Streamlit demo in the demo folder, showcasing the baseline model.
The demo model achieves ~87% confidence, whereas the fully trained model achieves 92% confidence.
The full integration of the high-confidence model with the frontend was not completed before the deadline.

2️⃣ Challenges Encountered
Last-minute technical breakdowns prevented full frontend integration.
Limited time due to the hackathon deadline restricted further development.

3️⃣ Current Deliverables
Demo Folder: Streamlit app using the 87% confidence model, submitted via YouTube video for demonstration.
Src Folder: Main code including main.py, model.py, other scripts, and project assets.
Screenshots: Visuals of frontend interface, predictions, and outputs available via Google Drive links for proof of work on frontend:

4️⃣ Next Steps / Planned Improvements
Integrate the 92% confidence model fully with the frontend.
Fix remaining bugs in frontend interaction.
Improve transformer demand accuracy, which could boost the overall model significantly; due to data scraping challenges, it is inaccurate as of now.
